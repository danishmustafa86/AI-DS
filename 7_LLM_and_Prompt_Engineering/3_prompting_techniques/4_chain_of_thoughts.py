# Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting is a technique in prompt engineering where a model is guided to solve a problem by breaking it down into intermediate reasoning steps. Instead of directly generating the final answer, the model is prompted to "think aloud" by producing a sequence of logical steps that lead to the solution. This approach mimics human problem-solving and is particularly useful for complex tasks like math problems, logical reasoning, or multi-step decision-making. By explicitly showing the reasoning process, CoT prompting improves the model's accuracy, transparency, and ability to handle challenging problems.

Solve the following math problem step by step:

Problem: A bakery sells 15 cupcakes in the morning and 20 cupcakes in the afternoon. Each cupcake costs $2. How much money did the bakery make in total?

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cupcakes sold.
- Morning cupcakes: 15
- Afternoon cupcakes: 20
- Total cupcakes sold = 15 + 20 = 35

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue.
- Price per cupcake: $2
- Total revenue = Total cupcakes sold * Price per cupcake
- Total revenue = 35 * 2 = $70

Final Answer: The bakery made $70 in total.
